## First Things First

### When?

November, 10–11.

### Where?

The main campus of TU München (Technical University of Munich) in—you guessed it—Munich, Germany.

### How to keep track of the updates?

We're [@dachfest](https://twitter.com/dachfest) on Twitter! You can also join the conversation about both DACHFest and the GDG DevFest season 2018 through the hashtags: #DevFest18 and #DACHFest.

We'll also be emailing important information to all registered attendees, along with the check-in instructions prior to the conference.


## Tickets

### What kinds of tickets do you offer?

All our ticket tiers offer the same kind of access; there's no extras or special sign-ups.

### Why is the price different then?

We are a non-profit event driven by the community, and we try to keep our tickets as close to being at-cost as we can.

If your employer covers your ticket, we are asking for the company to bear the full ticket cost. If you pay for your ticket yourself—especially if you're a student without an opportunity to work full-time—we want to help you, and that's why our self-funded and student tickets come at a reduced price.

### Can I buy a ticket for someone else?

Awww, please do! ❤️

When buying a ticket (or several tickets at once), you will be asked to specify the recepient's name for each one. You can also fill in the names later—in case you want to pre-purchase a batch of tickets for your employees, for example.

### Are the tickets transferrable?

There's no established procedure, but get in touch at [contact@dachfest.com](mailto:contact@dachfest.com), and we'll see what we can do.

Keep in mind that the badges are pre-printed a bit in advance, so if you want to transfer your ticket on a very short notice, your ticket recepient might end up getting a badge with your name on it. That would be pretty funny though, so we don't actually mind.

### What does "sponsor a diversity ticket" mean?

We award a limited number of diversity scholarships (see below) for people who belong to an underrepresented groups in tech and for people who would find it hard to attend otherwise. When you sponsor a diversity ticket, the number of scholarships go up by one! You are giving one more person a chance to enjoy the conference, how cool is that?


## Diversity Scholarships

### What if I can't afford the ticket?

If you can't afford our ticket price, you are eligible to apply for a [diversity scholarship](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfUErEWRxKJ4I9GJ3O3-QXeI8_SavoVxTS7jTj1Emv5OMdZgg/viewform). Please don't hesitate and don't be shy: diversity scholarships are funded by our sponsors and your fellow attendees, who are happy to help!

### Who else is eligible for a diversity scholarships?

Anyone who belongs to an underrepresented community in tech or experiences financial hardship. Please see the [application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfUErEWRxKJ4I9GJ3O3-QXeI8_SavoVxTS7jTj1Emv5OMdZgg/viewform) for details.

### Does the scholarship include accommodation and travel?

Depending on travel distance and cost, we might be able to help you get to Munich.

Unfortunately, we don't cover accommodation, but we encourage you to discuss living arrangements with other attendees and fellow scholarship recipients: they may suggest affordable options or even be willing to share a place!

### What is the scholarship application deadline?

October 10 is the application deadline. You will be notified by October 15, which should give you ample time to make travel arrangements.


## Pictures and Videos

### Will the talks be recorded?

Yes! All talks will be recorded and released shortly after the conference, unless the speaker explicitly requested for their talk not to be.

### Can't go, but I'd love to watch the talks live. Is there a stream?

We're sad to hear that! The conference talks will possibly be streamed (we're working on it), but you'll miss out on social activities, workshops, networking, and lots of fun. Are you sure you can't make it?

### Will there be photography?

Yes, the event will be photographed and videographed. However, if you don't want to be on any photos and videos, including crowd photos, we respect your choice: we will have color-coded lanyards that will show your picture and video preferences (tentatively, it's yellow for asking permission, and red for no pictures).

### Can I take pictures and videos?

Same rules apply to you: feel free to take pictures of videos of everything except people who indicated they don't want photos or videos of them taken with their lanyards.

**Note:** several talks will have the audience recorded on camera. Those will be announced in advance, and the area outside of the camera view will be clearly indicated.


## Diversity and Inclusion

### Do you have a code of conduct?

Yes. We have a [code of conduct](/conduct) that everyone agrees to comply with when buying a ticket, as well as two supplementary documents: [violation reporting guidelines](/violation-reporting) that you might want to read if you want to be more efficient at reporting a code of conduct violation, and [incident response guidelines](/incident-response) for our staff.

### I generally don't feel welcomed at tech events. Is yours different?

We certainly hope so, and we are trying our best to make everyone feel included and happy at DACHFest. We care about your dietary requirements, accessibility needs, picture preferences, and pronouns.

We will also have a quiet lounge where you will be able to rest in a peaceful environment with some low-key sessions on self-care and mental health.

### What about accessibility?

We have a detailed [accessibility statement](/accessibility) where you can get all the information you need.

### Will you have captioning?

We are working on providing open captioning for both talk tracks.

### Will you have gender-neutral bathrooms?

Yes, several bathrooms will be designated as gender-neutral.


## At the Conference

### What is there to do?

We are going to have talks, hands-on workshops, demo areas and booths from our sponsors, a lot of networking opportunities, and enough Club-Mate to swim in it (we are in Germany, after all). There will be community and project presentations, too, as well as some after-hour activities that we will announce later!

In addition, there will be a quiet room in case you want to get away from the noise for a while.

### Will there be food?

We will serve lunch and modest breakfast on both days, and coffee throughout the event.

If you have dietary restrictions, there is a field to specify them while buying your ticket.

### Are the talks in English or German?

All DACHFest talks are given in English.

### Is there a dress code?

There is no enforced dress code, be comfortable and casual. Please make sure your idea of "comfortable and casual" complies with our [code of conduct](/conduct) though.

### Can I smoke?

Please do not smoke or vape in the venue or near the entrance—it can make other attendees uncomfortable.


## Miscellaneous

### Are you able to help me with getting a visa?

We can issue you an invitation letter for the embassy. Please get in touch at [contact@dachfest.com](mailto:contact@dachfest.com) after buying your ticket.
